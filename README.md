✅ Game Title: CandleStick Game
🕹️ How to Play
📈 You are drawing a candlestick chart (like in trading).

🔼 Press Arrow Up to move the candle up (a green candle – price rising).

🔽 Press Arrow Down to move the candle down (a red candle – price falling).

➡️ Press Arrow Right to lock the current candle and start a new one to the right.

💰 Your goal is to collect good news and avoid bad news bubbles while building the candle chart.

⚠️ Avoid This!
🚫 Hitting red news bubbles (e.g., “Crash”, “Recession”) ends the game!

💥 You must touch something within 35 seconds or your position closes (game over).

🎯 Collect This!
✅ Green bubbles = Positive news → gives you money and helps the candle grow up.

💎 Blue bubbles = Superseed bonus → reduces penalty count (lets you stay in the game longer).

🧠 Strategy Tips
🕒 The longer you avoid hitting things and play smart, the more you earn.

🎯 Try to build up your candle steadily, then move right with Arrow Right.

🚀 Survive as long as you can without hitting red bubbles!
